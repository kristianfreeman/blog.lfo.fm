As mentioned in the first blog post on [this site](/hello-world), LFO soft-launched earlier this week, via Reddit's [/r/wearethemusicmakers](https://reddit.com/r/wearethemusicmakers) subreddit.

The post and the site received a ton of useful (and tough) feedback! Since then, I've been heads-down rethinking some parts of the site, being sure to pay attention to what worked, but also what _didn't_ work. In this post, I want to explictly mention some of the feedback and how it's being addressed in the immediate future.

## Insurance

Of all the comments on the Reddit post, where we received the majority of our feedback over the last couple days, those regarding insurance were the highest upvoted.

Let me start by emphatically saying the obvious: **I kinda blew this part of the launch**. Surprisingly, a number of larger "niche" marketplaces like LFO that I've spent time researching and using as inspiration for the project have an insurance policy that's basically "you should really have insurance if you're using our site".

LFO has a similar approach at launch day. That being said, I think the site can do a bit better - because of that, I'm making it a priority, so that it's something we really excel at.

What does that mean in practice?

**In the short-term, we're introducing verification as part of the sign-up process.** When a user signs up, we'll require them to submit an ID or other identifying piece of information so that we can confirm they're really who they say they are. Until they've done this, they'll be unable to rent on the site.

We're also working on a system to support listers in the worst-case. **This is our most immediate priority right now!** There's a number of excellent marketplaces that handle this giving renters two options at the beginning of the rental: a *low-cost damage waiver* (for instance, [KitSplit's $5 Damage Waiver](https://kitsplit.com/insurance), which covers up to $10k in equipment for $5), or *placing a hold on the renter's credit card*, during the duration of the rental.

This is the ideal solution, in my opinion, that we can offer to solve the insurance problem. That being said, every type of marketplace is different: most music instruments are more durable than the camera lenses that KitSplit offers, for instance, so the terms may shake out to be slightly different. We're looking for the right partner to help offer something like this, so it might take some time to get this right. By the way - if you're that company: [get in touch with us](mailto:support@lfo.fm)!

## Shipping

A number of people expressed concern about shipping their instruments. That's super reasonable! I have a number of synthesizers that are pretty small, so the implications of shipping them is a lot less than, say, an electric guitar.

Shipping was introduced on the platform because it allows a small amount of users to still connect over the platform. For instance, given less than 50 users, some in Austin, some in Los Angeles, etc, having under 100 listings on the site with shipping enabled might allow us to still do bookings.

While we _could_ do that, a lot of the feedback on Reddit specifically mentioned two things around shipping: cost, and safety. Shipping my [MicroBrute](https://lfo1.sharetribe.com/en/listings/718300-arturia-microbrute) costs $12, but shipping a Telecaster probably costs _way_ more. In addition, what if a lister does a good job sending the instrument, but the renter sends it back woefully under-packed?

I want to address shipping _when we have a really good story around shipping_. To be frank, just leaving it up to listers and renters isn't good enough! The implications of losing an instrument that's really precious is too high.

**Because of this, we're disabling shipping across the site for the time being, effectively making rentals localized to the listers' locations.** This means that we need to put a higher emphasis on local rentals: that will change a great deal of how we approach content, marketing, etc. Hope to have more on this soon!

## Will it work?

The final category of comments on the Reddit post asked a pretty obvious question: "will this even work?"

The economics of a marketplace are pretty straightforward: we take a transaction fee, and that's how we make money. As I mentioned, LFO is a "bootstrapped" marketplace. We haven't taken investment, and we're not obligated to make $10 million over the next year on these fees (or by doing something else to make money, like selling your info).

The advantage to this is really great: LFO is "working" if it's turning a profit, and we're operating at really minimal cost. The upside is high, too! If we succeed, we get to build a really cool community of musicians around the world.

**But will it work? Frankly, I don't know!** Most startup ideas fail, but it's in my bootstrap blood to try this idea out, without taking on huge investment or obligations, so that if it _does_ fail, it's not the end of the world.

Candidly, the plan with LFO is that I'm giving it about three to six months to become "successful". Success is really simple, in this case - so much so that this is literally the criteria I'm using in private to evaluate this project:

- Are people _listing_ their instruments on the site?
- Are people _renting_ instruments on the site?
- Are we making _enough_ money to cover our expenses? ([ShareTribe](https://sharetribe.com) plan, hosting fees, etc)

Given that criteria, it allows the project to be hyper-focused on two things: increasing listings, and increasing rentals. Everything else is superfluous - better design, cool/high-budget advertising, etc. We just need to get people on the platform and listing stuff! I have a lot of ideas around this, and I'll continue to write about them in the future.

## Conclusion

I had a bit of a moment of crisis after the Reddit post - people online are always very critical! A lot of people were very convinced that this won't work: you can check out the thread for a lot of people with strong opinions about how "Airbnb for music gear" is _literally_ the worst idea of all-time. I'm not sure that's the case, but I'm actually pretty curious if this will work too! I'll keep writing about the process in the meantime - how I'm thinking about improving the site in the short-term, and, as we get closer to the "evaluation date", how I'm thinking about go versus no-go with the future of the site.
