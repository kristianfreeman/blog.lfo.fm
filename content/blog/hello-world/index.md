Hey, world! [Kristian](https://twitter.com/signalnerve) from LFO here - I'm super excited to be writing the first post on our blog!

We're building a marketplace for musicians around the world. A lot of us have gear we want to try out, gear that sits in our garage being unused, etc. LFO is designed to connect those instruments with musicians who want to play them, use them in recordings, or even tour with them!

We soft-launched [on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/aurr0x/im_building_airbnb_for_your_music_gear_so_you_can/) at the beginning of this week, reaching out to musicians on the /r/wearethemusicmakers subreddit. The post took off quickly: at time of writing, it's the #3 top-voted post of the last week!

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Top post on this subreddit with ~600k subscribers right now 🥳 <a href="https://t.co/lMsy51Mu6N">pic.twitter.com/lMsy51Mu6N</a></p>&mdash; @signalnerve (@signalnerve) <a href="https://twitter.com/signalnerve/status/1100242760282574850?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 26, 2019</a></blockquote>

We still have some kinks to work out - more on that in the next post on this blog - but we're super excited to have launched, and to start bringing users on the platform. We want to build an incredible network of musicians around the world, sharing and working on projects together. If you're interested, consider [following us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/lfoapp) and getting involved in the platform! We'd love to have you :)
